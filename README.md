Great observation! Since your first two projects are hosted on Kaggle and involve specific machine learning models, while the latest one is a complete end-to-end system, you can organize your portfolio to highlight the distinction between **Model-Based Projects** and **End-to-End Systems**. Here's an updated structure:

## Projects

### Model-Based Projects

These projects showcase my expertise in building machine learning models and analyzing data for specific tasks:

- [Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ialiasghar/sentiment-analysis-of-restaurant-reviews): Built a sentiment analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify restaurant reviews as positive or negative.
- [Plant Growth Milestone Prediction Using Environmental Factors](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ialiasghar/plant-growth-milestone-prediction-using-environmen): Analyzed environmental factors like sunlight, temperature, and humidity, and built multiple models to predict plant growth milestones and identify optimal growing conditions.

### End-to-End Systems

These projects demonstrate my ability to build complete systems for real-world applications:


- **[HyperQuery - AI-Powered NL2SQL Interface](https://github.com/iamAliAsgharKhan/HyperQuery)**: Created an end-to-end system that converts natural language questions into SQL queries using Groq's Llama3-70B model. Features include:
  - Dynamic schema awareness for SQLite databases
  - Safe read-only query execution
  - Interactive web interface with responsive HTML tables
  - Full-stack implementation with FastAPI backend and vanilla JS frontend
  - Pydantic validation for type-safe SQL generation


- [Groq-Powered RAG Webapp for Obsidian Files](https://github.com/iamAliAsgharKhan/Groq-Powered-RAG-Webapp-for-Obsidian-Files): Developed a web application using Groq's LLM for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to query and interact with Obsidian Markdown files. The system includes Markdown file indexing, context-aware query responses, real-time reindexing, and a responsive web-based interface.
